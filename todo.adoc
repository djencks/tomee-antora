= TODO for playbook and content

== Playbook

=== Make it easy to work locally

This probably involves an "author" playbook with at least one file system source url, together with instructions on how to arrange a set of workspaces.

== Content

=== Determine if 'common' component should be rendered by Antora

=== Provide thought-out nav files for all content

=== Organize content in modules or topics by subject area

=== Examine the adoc files that, in the current site, are generated and determine if this is appropriate in an Antora site.

=== Consider if ventilated prose should be a TomEE documentation standard.
