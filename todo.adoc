== Playbook

=== Make it easy to work locally

This probably involves an "author" playbook with at least one file system source url, together with instructions on how to arrange a set of workspaces.

=== {done} Set up maven build.

The camel-website project might provide inspiration.

=== Determine how this can relate to other parts of the site build.

== Content

=== Determine if 'common' component should be rendered by Antora

==== Prototype start page as asciidoc/Antora.

It will need another layout, and some special css.

=== Provide thought-out nav files for all content

=== Organize content in modules or topics by subject area

=== Examine the adoc files that, in the current site, are generated and determine if this is appropriate in an Antora site.

=== Consider if ventilated prose should be a TomEE documentation standard.

=== Update content to actual TomEE git repos.
